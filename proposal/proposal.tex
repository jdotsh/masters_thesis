\section{Motivation \& Problem Statement}

Priority queues are abstract data structures which store a set of key/value pairs
and allow efficient access to the item with the minimal (maximal) key. Such queues are an important
element in various areas of computer science such as algorithmics (i.e. Dijkstra's shortest
path algorithm) and operating system (i.e. priority schedulers).

The recent trend towards multiprocessor computing requires new implementations of basic
data structures which are able to be used concurrently and scale well to a large number
of threads. In particular, lock-free structures promise superior scalability by avoiding
the use of blocking synchronization primitives.

However, priority queues in particular are challenging to parallelize efficiently since
the \lstinline|delete_min| operation causes high contention at the minimal (maximal) element.
Even though concurrent priority queues have been extensively researched over the past decades,
a good solution has not yet been reached.

A recent promising approach has been through relaxation of provided guarantees, i.e.
allowing the priority queue to return one of the $k$ minimal items. The $k$-LSM is a lock-free
priority queue design which follows this approach and displays high scalability in initial
benchmarks. However, it is currently only available integrated into the task-scheduling framework
Pheet\footnote{\url{www.pheet.org}} and thus cannot be compared directly to other recent designs.

Within this thesis, a standalone version of the $k$-LSM priority queue will be developed and
compared extensively with state of the art concurrent priority queues.

\section{Expected Results}

There are several goals of this thesis: first, to provide a solid implementation of the $k$-LSM
which may easily be compared against other priority queues and/or used in practice. This implies not
only that the implementation must be efficient and correct, but it also needs to be reliable and
easy to to understand. Ideally, the scalability at high thread counts will also be improved
by following up on several potential optimization ideas.

Second, to gain an in-depth understanding of the $k$-LSM's behavior in different situations. In
recent literature on concurrent priority queues, a simply uniform throughput benchmark (in which
each thread performs 50\% insertions, 50\% deletions of uniformly random keys) has often
been the main performance evaluation tool - but is this benchmark appropriate and does it accurately
reflect a design's performance? And how do these data structures perform on different machines
and architectures? This thesis will investigate answers to these questions and present comparisons
against other current designs.

And finally, to provide an extensive overview of the development of priority queues, reaching
from sequential queues through early lock-based concurrent designs and several variations of
lock-free skiplist-based queues, to recent work which has often focused on various relaxation
approaches. Special focus will be given to the $k$-LSM implementation including all of its
intricacies such as memory management in a lock-free environment.
